# **Collection of Chrome Browser Extension** :blush:

### I started to challenge myself to build my own _Chrome Extension_. Although I referenced online resources to build the extensions which are probably available on the internet, I tried to build extensions by my own way and these are reasons I decided to create Chrome Extension:
1. Improve and level up my programming skill :star:
2. Enhance my problem-solving skill :grinning:
3. Contribute to my portfolio :relaxed: 
4. Make my life easier while surfing the internet. :tada:
