# **Collection of Chrome Browser Extensions** :blush:

### I started to challenge myself to build my own _Chrome Extension_. Although I referenced online resources to build the extensions which are probably available on the internet, I tried to build extensions by my own way and these are reasons I decided to create Chrome Extension:
1. Improve and level up my programming skill :star:
2. Enhance my problem-solving skill :grinning:
3. Contribute to my portfolio :relaxed: 
4. Make my life easier while surfing the internet. :tada:

### **Instruction:**
1. Click **Clone or Download** and then **Download ZIP** ![ZIP](/images/1.PNG)
2. Unzip the zip file that you have downloaded
3. Open Chrome Browser and type **chrome://extensions** ![image](/images/2.PNG)
4. Look at the top right corner, and click to turn on **Developer Mode** ![image](/images/3.PNG)
5. Click **Load unpacked**

6. Open folder unzipped in step 2, and then choose the extension you want to upload. For example: You would like to upload **Double-Clicked Dictionary**, then open *extension_collection-master* folder and give one click on *Double-Clicked Dictionary* folder, and finally *Select folder* (Window OS applied)
